phonegap-plugins
================

Ant build file which allows to add in easy way any of existing phonegap plugins. 

Feel free to add any of new phonegap plugin or use and edit this file in your phonegap projects.

The main goal of the creation of this file was to facilitate the process of building applications on multiple devices, working units and seperate testing of web part from native part (thanks to that there is no need to keep plugins, platform files in the repo but only web related stuff which is lighter for CI also).
